# Caddy

> __tl;dr__ It's just like [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com), but with Hetzner DNS plugin build in!

Push a tag like `v2.4.6` onto this repository and the builds should start automatically.

*ATTENTION!* You need to make sure that the tag exists on Caddy's side.


## TODO

* Trigger build automatically when new versions of Caddy have been released
* Sanitize pushed tags to `x.y.z` semver format
